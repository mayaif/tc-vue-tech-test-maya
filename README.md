Simple Vue.js 3 to-do list app with task management features: add, edit, mark as done, delete tasks and search/filter by status (Not Started, In Progress, Complete).
- [Installation](./INSTALLATION.md)

This todo list app uses Pinia for state management to centralize and streamline handling of todos. The store manages the state, including fetching todos from an API ([JSON place holder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) `/users/1/todos`), performing CRUD operations and persisting data to localStorage. Esures reactive data across components, making state management more efficient and the app easier to maintain.
