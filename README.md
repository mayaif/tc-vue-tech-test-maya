Simple Vue.js 3 with TailwindCSS to-do list app with task management features: add, edit, mark as done, delete tasks and search/filter by status (Not Started, In Progress, Complete).
- [Installation](./INSTALLATION.md)

This todo list app uses Pinia for state management to centralize and streamline handling of todos. The store manages the state, including fetching todos from an API ([JSON place holder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) `/users/1/todos`), performing CRUD operations and persisting data to localStorage. Esures reactive data across components, making state management more efficient and the app easier to maintain.

The app is fully responsive across devices and meets WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards, including support for 400% content reflow, text resizing up 200%, text spacing, sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation and additional accessibility features.
